                    Hi, I'm Tasfia! I'm currently a Digital Tech student at Mount Albert Grammar School in New Zealand.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I love problem solving, maths and video games which has evolved into a love of coding. 
                    My skillset currently includes coding in Python, designing visually-appealing and 
                    user friendly websites, and creating websites using Html and CSS. If you would like to
                    see these skills in action, you should check out the 'Projects' page.
